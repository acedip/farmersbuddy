</A></H3>
<H4>I have no idea about soil classification</H4>
<P>I have prepared a short <A 
href="http://www.itc.nl/~rossiter/teach/soils/psc.pdf">Introduction to Soil 
Classification</A> (PDF, 33Kb) which you may find helpful. </P>
<P>Bob Ahrens of the NCSS (USA) has prepared a short article <A 
href="ftp://ftp-fc.sc.egov.usda.gov/NSSC/NCSS/Newsletters/issue19.pdf">"Soil 
classification: Past &amp; Present"</A> (PDF, 405Kb) from the US perspective. 
This gives a nice historical overview, emphasizing the soil series as the 
fundamental object of classification. 
<H4>Why so many systems?</H4>
<BLOCKQUOTE>"The purpose of any classification is so to organize our knowledge 
  that the properties of objects may be remembered and their relationships may 
  be understood most easily <I>for a specific objective</I>. The process 
  involves formation of classes by grouping the objects on the basis of their 
  common properties. In any system of classification, groups about which the 
  greatest number, most precise, and most important statements can be made 
  <I>for the objective</I> serve the purpose best." <BR>-- Marlin G. Cline, 
  "Basic Principles of Soil Classification", <I>Soil Science</I> <B>67</B>, 
  1949:81-91. </BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>So, different systems have different objectives. In particular, <A 
href="http://www.itc.nl/~rossiter/research/rsrch_ss_class.html#ST">Soil 
Taxonomy</A> was designed to group soil series in the USA in 
increasingly-general interpretive groups, whereas <A 
href="http://www.itc.nl/~rossiter/research/rsrch_ss_class.html#WRB">World 
Reference Base</A> and its predecessor <A 
href="http://www.itc.nl/~rossiter/research/rsrch_ss_class.html#FAO">FAO 
Legend</A> were designed to understand and organize world soil geography. 
<P>Yet another reason for different systems is different concepts of soils, 
classes of soils and in particular soil individuals. Thus the <A 
href="http://www.itc.nl/~rossiter/research/rsrch_ss_class.html#RPF">French</A> 
emphasize horizon assemblages, and don't require that a horizon sequence have 
only one classification. </P>
<P>And of course, <A 
href="http://www.itc.nl/~rossiter/research/rsrch_ss_class.html#Local">indigenous</A> 
people, that is, people living on and using the land, often have a 
classification based on perceived differences that are important to their uses. 
</P>
<P>Soil classification was once closely tied to the presumed <B>genesis</B> of 
the soil, but this has been replaced with <B>observable properties</B>; however 
these often have a strong genetic link. This connection for the WRB and ST is 
explored in <A href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0016-7061(99)00083-X">this 
article</A> by Bockheim &amp; Gennadiev. 
<UL>
  <LI>A <A 
  href="http://cals.arizona.edu/OALS/soils/classifsystems.html">comparison of 
  soil classification systems</A>, including vernacular (local) systems, part of 
  a nice <A href="http://cals.arizona.edu/OALS/soils/">introduction to aridic 
  (desert) soils</A>, from the <A 
  href="http://ag.arizona.edu/OALS/IALC/Home.html">International Arid Lands 
  Consortium</A>. </LI></UL>
<H4>How can I translate a classification to a different system?</H4>
<P>Direct correspondence between classes is rare. However, many of the concepts 
from different systems are similar, and good ideas from one system often get 
taken up into another, so there is often a relatively good correlation. Most 
books which define a classification include correspondence tables. </P>
<P>The <A 
href="http://www.itc.nl/~rossiter/research/rsrch_ss_class.html#WRB">World 
Reference Base</A> project is probably the best <I>linga franca</I>, for three 
reasons: (1) it is intended to cover all soils of the world, (2) it was built 
with participation from almost all "schools" of classification, and (3) it tries 
as much as possible to use similar definitions, limits etc. as other systems. So 
one approach is to correlate all systems to WRB. Then a given class in one 
system can be correlated to a WRB class, then that WRB class to the target 
system. </P>
<P>There are some specific correlations that have been published: </P>

    <LI><A href="http://www.fao.org/ag/agl/agll/wrb/newkey.stm">Key to Reference

  <LI>The previous version of the WRB is <A 
  href="http://www.fao.org/ag/agl/agll/wrb/wrbdocs.stm">World Soil Resources 
  Reports 84</A> (1998); maps and reports from the period 1998-2006 will use 
  this. </LI></UL>
<P>The WRB is a two-level classification: </P>
<OL>
  <LI>30 <B>Reference Soil Groups</B>. Examples: Histols, Fluvisols, Luvisols 
  <LI><B>Subdivisions</B> of the Reference Soil Groups, using any defined 
  combination of 121 qualifiers. Examples: <I>Leptic Umbrisols</I>, 
  <I>Chromi-Vertic Luvisols</I>. It is possible to use either a single qualifier 
  (the most important) or all relevant qualifiers. 
  <P>The subdivisions do not take into account all possible differences among 
  soil map units. In particular: climate, parent material, vegetation, depth of 
  water table or drainage, and physiographic features such as slope, 
  geomorphology or erosion are not considered <I>as such</I>, except insofar as 
  they have affected soil morphology. These features can be used locally to 
  defined <I>mapping phases</I>, but they are not considered soil properties to 
  be classified as such. </P>
  <P>Some detailed internal properties are also not considered at this level of 
  detail, namely, substratum layers, thickness and morphology of solum or 
  individual horizons. These can be used to define series or forms locally, for 
  detailed soil survey. </P></LI></OL>
<P>The WRB borrows heavily from modern soil classification concepts, including 
<A href="http://www.itc.nl/~rossiter/research/rsrch_ss_class.html#ST">Soil 
Taxonomy</A>, the legend for the <A 
href="http://www.itc.nl/~rossiter/research/rsrch_ss_class.html#FAO">FAO Soil Map 
of the World</A> 1988, the <A 
href="http://www.itc.nl/~rossiter/research/rsrch_ss_class.html#RPF">Référentiel 
Pédologique</A>, and Russian concepts. The emphasis is on soil morphology, and a 
major difference with Soil Taxonomy is that soil climate is not part of the 
system, except in so far as the effects of climate affect soil properties. As 
far as possible, diagnostic criteria match those of existing systems, so that 
correlation with national and previous international systems is as 
straightforward as possible. </P>
<P>The WRB is not intended to be used in semi-detailed or detailed mapping; many 
detailed soil properties that are important for land use and soil behaviour are 
not specified in sufficient detail in the two levels of the WRB. For detailed 
mapping and site characterisation, local organisations or survey projects are 
expected to use locally-defined soil series, soil forms, or similar. The WRB is 
used to group these locally-defined soils for correlation and communication.

Vietnamese, Rumanian, Hapanese and Lithuanian; Chinese and Russian are in

<P>This system was first published in 1975, and has undergone 8 revisions since. 
It is a hierarchical classification that tries to group similar soils into 
increasingly general categories. It was designed to support soil survey in the 
USA, specifically the correlation of soil series and the provision of map unit 
names at various levels of cartographic detail. It tries to classify all World 
soils, but the main aim has always been to group soils of the USA. </P>

    clarified and modernized concets, it proposes a clear and well-defined

  <P class=explain>This is an approach to soil classification that is completely 
  at odds with Soil Taxonomy. Instead of a rigid hierarchical classification 
  system, we have a set of 102 reference solums (<I>not</I> polypedons!) which 
  result from unique interpretations of morphology, genesis and function. A soil 
  in the field can be assigned to one or more references; this fits with the 
  idea of fuzzy classification. It merits close study.

<P>An alternative to hierarchical classification systems based on expert 
judgement about pedogenesis is an objective classification based on the actual 
differences between individuals. These are usually called "ordination" because 
they attempt to impose an order on the actual data. The usual idea is to 
minimize within-class variance, and maximize between-class variance, according 
to some objective criterion. It is somewhat similar to unsupervised 
classification in image processing: the information, rather than the 
pre-conceptions of the classifie, guides the classification. </P>

</A></H4>
<P>Civil engineers view soil as a foundation or building material. They have 
developed several classifications of soil as an earthy material. The classes are 
directly related to the manner of using the soil for civil engineering. These 
technical systems are designed to <B>predict the engineering properties and 
behavior</B> of a soil based on a <B>few simple laboratory or field tests</B>. 
</P>
<P>The most common is the <B>Unified</B> Soil Classification, with three major 
groups: (1) coarse grain, (2) fine grain, and (3) highly organic. These groups 
are then subdivided as follows: </P>
<OL>
  <LI>Coarse grain: gravels, sands 
  <LI>Fine grain: silts, clays, organics silts &amp; clays 
  <LI>Organic soils </LI></OL>
<P>These are then subdivided according to their plasticity (for fine soils and 
coarse soils with some fines) and homogeneity (for coarse soils). </P>

<P>Soil classification tends to ignore or downplay the diversity of topsoil 
characteristics, mainly because they can change fairly rapidly under human 
influence. However, the topsoil determines to a large extent soil-related Land 
Qualities, especially for infiltration, erosion, crusting and other surface 
processess. 
<P>To fill this gap, a draft proposal has been developed by ISRIC and FAO. This 
is an important development, and soil scientists working with surface processes 
should test the classification to see if it is a useful stratification for their 
purposes.
