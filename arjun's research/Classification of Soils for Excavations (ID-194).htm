      <BLOCKQUOTE><SPAN class=blueTen>When a trench or other excavation is 
        made in soil, the residual forces in the ground work to restore the soil 
        to a more stable configuration. If those residual forces (gravity) are 
        greater than those holding the trench or excavation walls where they 
        are, a cave-in occurs. There are a number of factors which determine the 
        stability of a given excavation wall. It is beyond the scope of this 
        document to fully describe soil mechanics in this way. However, it has 
        been found empirically that soil, when sloped appropriately, will resist 
        the residual forces and remain safely stable.<BR><BR>Because the 
        evaluation of soil conditions and structure is crucial to safe operation 
        in and around excavations, an excavation standard was among the first 
        promulgated by OSHA in 1971. In that standard, soils were classified 
        into three types called running, unstable, and hard compact (Ref. 3.2). 
        These terms were generally misunderstood. Later, the terms were revised 
        and renamed granular, cohesive, granular cohesionless, and cemented 
        (Ref. 3.1).<BR><BR>In 1989, it was estimated that there were 70 
        fatalities and more than 800 lost workday injuries annually in the 
        United States due to excavation accidents. Responding to this high 
        incidence rate, OSHA promulgated the current excavation standards (Ref 
        3.1) and it has the following requirements:</SPAN> 
        <OL>
          <LI>Classification of soil and rock deposits. Each soil and rock 
          deposit shall be classified by a competent person as Stable Rock, Type 
          A, Type B, or Type C in accordance with the definitions set forth in 
          29 CFR 1926 Subpart P Appendix A. 
          <LI>Basis of classification. The classification of the deposits shall 
          be made based on the results of at least one visual and at least one 
          manual analysis. Such analyses shall be conducted by a competent 
          person using tests described in 29 CFR 1926 Subpart P Appendix A, or 
          in other recognized methods of soil classification and testing such as 
          those adopted by the American Society for Testing Materials, or the 
          U.S. Department of Agriculture textural classification system. 
          <LI>Visual and manual analyses. The visual and manual analyses, such 
          as those noted as being acceptable in 29 CFR 1926 Subpart P Appendix 
          A, shall be designed and conducted to provide sufficient quantitative 
          and qualitative information as may be necessary to identify properly 
          the properties, factors, and conditions affecting the classification 
          of the deposits. 
          <LI>Layered systems. In a layered system, the system shall be 
          classified in accordance with its weakest layer. However, each layer 
          may be classified individually where a more stable layer lies under a 
          less stable layer. 
          <LI>Reclassification. If, after classifying a deposit, the properties, 
          factors, or conditions affecting its classification change in any way, 
          the changes shall be evaluated by a competent person. The deposit 
          shall be reclassified as necessary to reflect the changed 
          circumstances. </LI></OL><SPAN class=blueTen>As a result of the new 
        regulations, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported, in 1999, 44 deaths 
        due to excavation and trenching accidents. (Ref. 3.10)<BR><BR>The angle 
        of the slope depends upon the properties of the soil in which the 
        excavation has been made. The mineral particles that constitute soil and 
        other earth materials can bond by chemical and physical forces that 
        oppose the force of gravity. Chemical bonding, or cohesion, refers to 
        the chemical forces that bond mineral particles. Physical bonding refers 
        to the bonding of the more coarse grains such as sand and gravel by 
        frictional forces that include the interlocking of particles.<BR><BR>29 
        CFR 1926 Subpart P Appendix A is based on site and environmental 
        conditions, and on the structure and composition of the soil deposits. 
        The soil classification system means a method of categorizing soil and 
        rock deposits in a hierarchy of Stable Rock, Type A, Type B, and Type C, 
        in decreasing order of stability.</SPAN>

        making, OSHA relied heavily on a classification system developed in 1982 
        by the National Bureau of Standards (now the National Institute of 
        Standards and Technology - NIST). In addition, OSHA used several other 
        sources of information including ASTM standards. (Ref. 3.10)<BR><BR>In 
        addition to these fundamental references, SLTC used <SPAN 
        class=italic>The Unified Soil Classification System</SPAN> (Refs. 3.3 
        and 3.4), the<SPAN class=italic> Engineering Geology Field Manual of the 
        U.S. Bureau of Reclamation</SPAN> (Ref. 3.5), and other documents (Refs. 
        3.6-3.9) in the development of this method.<BR><BR>OSHA Method ID-194 
        was developed to emphasize the performance and engineering properties of 
        soil and is consistent with the objectives and requirements of the 1989 
        Federal excavation regulations. Many other methods used to classify soil 
        provide a textural name for soil such as clay, silty clay, sandy clay, 
        clay loam and, in some cases, silty clay loam and sandy clay loam. 
        Because each of these methods specify slightly different tests, the 
        names are similar to each other but can have a different meaning. An 
        attempt is made to provide a textural name of the soil with this OSHA 
        method (so that a comparison can be made with other methods) but a 
        compete separation of all of the soil components is not performed by the 
        tests described in this method. This could result in a textural name 
        that is slightly different from other soil classifying methods.</SPAN>

            <LI>Unconfined Compressive Strength (Ref. 3.1) <BR><BR>Within five 
            minutes after a sample of broken soil is exposed to the open air, 
            remove one or more of the largest clumps and analyze it with a 
            pocket penetrometer. Slice each clump with a spatula to provide a 
            smooth surface for analysis.<BR><BR>Press the penetrometer cylinder 
            against the sample and compress the soil and the calibrated spring 
            of the instrument to the marked ring on the cylinder. Read the 
            position of the ring on the calibrated scale of the cylinder. Record 
            the unconfined compressive strength reading in tons per square foot 
            (tsf) or kilograms per square centimeter (kg/cm<SUP>2</SUP>). Report 
            the average of at least three readings if possible. Note all samples 
            that break apart and do not provide a positive analysis.<BR>&nbsp; 
            <LI>Plasticity (Refs. 3.3 and 3.4)<BR><BR>Plasticity is defined as 
            an inherent property of certain soils to mold and roll between the 
            palms of the hands into a stable thread 0.3 cm ( in.) in diameter 
            and the tensile strength to support a 5-cm section when held at one 
            end. To possess plasticity for classification purposes, the soil 
            must satisfy these conditions and contain at least 15% silt and clay 
            as determined by gradation analysis.<BR><BR>Determine and record the 
            state of plasticity of the soil at the as-received water content. If 
            plasticity is not observed, analyze the sample after it is dried 
            using only that part of the sample that passes the #40 sieve. Add 
            water in different amounts to obtain a wide range of water content 
            for analysis. If the clay content is low, plasticity is not an 
            inherent property of the soil, and it will not be identified at any 
            water content.<BR>&nbsp; 
            <LI>Gradation Analysis (Ref. 3.3)<BR><BR>This test is used to 
            determine the amount of gravel, sand, and total silt and clay in a 
            soil sample. These constituents are identified using the particle 
            size scale of the Unified Soil classification system. Silt and clay 
            are not distinguished from each other in this test. The gradation 
            procedures are described as follows:<BR><BR>Dry the soil for 2 days 
            at 60°C to prepare the soil for analysis. Vent the air from the oven 
            to the outside to avoid exposure to possible toxic 
            fumes.<BR><BR>Tare a bowl on a laboratory balance. Add at least 100 
            g of a dry fine-grained sample or 200 g of a coarse-grained sample 
            (sand and gravel) to the bowl. If that amount is not available, use 
            as much as possible. Record the weight and cover the sample with 
            water. Let it stand in this state for at least 2 hours and up to 24 
            hours.<BR><BR>Transfer this material to a #200 wet sieving pan and 
            wash the fine grains of silt and clay through the sieve with running 
            water until it is visibly clear. Wash the material that is retained 
            on this sieve back into the bowl and decant the water and any 
            supernatant. Dry this residue at 60°C or at any other preferred 
            temperature.<BR><BR>Place the dried soil onto a nest of pans 
            containing a #4 sieve at the top, a #200 sieve in the middle, and a 
            pan at the bottom to catch any residual silt and clay. Tap the pans 
            manually on a table top at least 20 times to separate the grains by 
            size.<BR><BR>Report the total gravel as the weight of material 
            retained on the top or #4 sieve and the total sand as the weight of 
            material retained on the next or #200 sieve. The total silt and clay 
            content is equal to the difference between the combined weight of 
            the sand and gravel and the weight of the sample used. Silt and clay 
            comprise the fine-grained material that is washed through the #200 
            sieve during analysis. Convert the weight of the material retained 
            on the #4 sieve and the #200 sieve as the dry weight percent of the 
            gravel and sand, respectively. </LI></OL></BLOCKQUOTE><SPAN
